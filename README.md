## Hi there! I'm Komal üëã

A Remote Sensing & Geospatial Scientist with 4+ years of experience in WRF-based atmospheric modeling, GIS automation, and satellite-based methane detection. I'm passionate about leveraging satellite observations and geospatial data to understand and address environmental challenges.

### My Technical Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

My work leverages a robust stack for geospatial data science, atmospheric modeling, and cloud-based operations:

* **Programming & Data Science:**
    * **Python:** Extensive use for data analysis, ML, scientific computing (including `netCDF4`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`).
    * **R, MATLAB:** For statistical analysis and specific scientific computations.
    * **Machine Learning:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Bayesian Models, Experiment Tracking (WandB - Weights & Biases).

* **Geospatial & Remote Sensing:**
    * **GIS Software:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, QGIS.
    * **Cloud-based Geospatial:** Google Earth Engine (GEE, GEEmap, LeafMap).
    * **Atmospheric Modeling:** WRF-ARW, WPS, Vensim (for systems modeling).
    * **Spatial Data Processing:** ArcPy, NetCDF & GRIB data handling, FFmpeg (for time-series visualization).

* **Cloud & HPC:**
    * **AWS CLI:** Hands-on experience with S3 buckets for cloud data storage and transfer (downloading folders, recursive operations, sync).
    * **Linux Command Line & Shell Scripting:** Proficient in navigation, file/directory management (`chown`, `du`, `df`), process management (`ps aux`, `kill`), and shell scripting for automation.
    * **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Environments:** Comfortable operating in remote server environments via SSH.
    * **Docker:** Understanding of containerization for packaging applications and dependencies (`docker exec`, best practices).

* **Development Workflow & Tools:**
    * **Version Control:** Git (commands like `clone`, `branch`, `checkout`, `add`, `commit`, `merge`, `pull`, `push`) and GitLab.
    * **Terminal Multiplexing:** tmux (sessions, panes, copy mode, keybindings) for robust remote work.
    * **IDEs & Notebooks:** VS Code (with Jupyter integration), PyCharm, Jupyter Lab/Notebooks.
    * **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Affinity Designer.

Key Projects
üî¨ My work focuses on developing impactful solutions in remote sensing and geospatial data science. Here's a glimpse into some key projects, highlighting my approach and achievements:

üõ∞Ô∏è 1. Methane Flow Modeling (Current Internship at Satlantis US)
What I Did: Developed Python scripts to compute cross-sectional methane (CH4) flow from WRF-ARW outputs, coupled with advanced image processing to isolate and analyze atmospheric methane plumes. I also automated time-series processing of NetCDF data.

What I Achieved: Streamlined the extraction of trace gas transport patterns, reducing manual analysis time by 50%. This project is geared towards enhancing the efficiency of methane detection and quantification from satellite observations.

How I Did It: Leveraged Python for scripting and spatial masking, integrating WRF-ARW outputs with advanced image processing techniques. Ensured collaborative version control using Git workflows.

üå°Ô∏è 2. Cholera Risk Prediction & Vibrio Suitability Mapping
What I Did: Designed and developed comprehensive cholera risk models, and engineered Bayesian models for monthly cholera prediction. Concurrently, I created detailed vibrio suitability models by analyzing large-scale satellite datasets and oceanographic variables.

What I Achieved: Significantly improved cholera prediction accuracy by 70% and expanded advanced forecasts for 10+ countries. My Bayesian models achieved 80% inference accuracy, while suitability models for 800+ locations demonstrated high performance with AUCs of 0.943 (Bootstrap), 0.889 (Subsample), and 0.862 (Cross-validation). Conducted precise laboratory analyses on 30+ ocean water samples, successfully detecting and quantifying multiple Vibrio species with 90% accuracy.

How I Did It: Utilized Python for processing and analyzing extensive satellite datasets (MODIS, GPM, MERRA, PACE, TRMM), conducting statistical modeling of 11+ oceanographic variables, and applying machine learning techniques to enhance vibrio dynamics insights and suitability mapping. Integrated ArcGIS Pro for spatial analysis and visualization.

üåä 3. Oceanographic Data Collection & Workflow Optimization (NSF Internship)
What I Did: Conducted comprehensive oceanographic data collection across 20+ field sites.

What I Achieved: Measured key parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, DO) with high precision (¬±0.2¬∞C, ¬±1%, ¬±0.2 pH, ¬±0.1 mg/L DO). Critically, I improved sampling workflows for real-time field data capture and validation, enhancing data quality and efficiency.

How I Did It: Employed YSI ProDSS for precise in-situ measurements and developed optimized protocols for data collection and initial validation.
